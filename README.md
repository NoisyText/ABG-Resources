> ## Description
> 
> Anywhere Board Games (ABG) allows users to play board and card games on the web in real time on multiple machines (PC, Linux, iPhone, iPad, and Android). ABG runs as a Google+ Hangout App (go to http://anywhereboardgames.com to start it), or as a stand-alone PHP app.
>
> Unlike other gaming environments, we had a peculiar vision: projecting the main board on our table and using laptops or tablets to control our hands (with other friends joining in remotely).
>
> ABG runs on PHP 5 and Apache (which is provided with the Windows installer). It supports flipping, stacking, rotating, rolling, and shuffling of pieces, so most board and card games are playable.
