#### You can find the most current code at [the SourceForge page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/boardgamearena/files/).

Note from NoisyText: I found Anywhere Board Games (ABG) when I was looking for a way to play checkers through a browser without people having to sign up or download anything. ABG has the ability to create and load game pieces of your choice. It comes with six-sided dice, deck of 52 cards, a flipping coin. Also included are all the boards and pieces needed to play Agricola Express, checkers, chess, go, reversi, and "Words" a generic version of Scrabble. 

You can create your own game pieces by importing images and assigning behaviors to them. Using ABG you can convert any board game you own and play online without any programming skill. 

Unfortunately I'm not a programmer, but I want other people on Github to find out about ABG in the hopes that you will enjoy it and contribute to the project. So this is my Github placeholder for Anywhere Board Games (http://anywhereboardgames.com/). Credit for the program goes to [doctor_butch over on SourceForge.org](http://sourceforge.net/u/userid-66675/profile/).

> # Anywhere-Board-Games
> ## Description
> 
> Anywhere Board Games (ABG) allows users to play board and card games on the web in real time on multiple machines (PC, Linux, iPhone, iPad, and Android). ABG runs as a Google+ Hangout App (go to http://anywhereboardgames.com to start it), or as a stand-alone PHP app.
>
> Unlike other gaming environments, we had a peculiar vision: projecting the main board on our table and using laptops or tablets to control our hands (with other friends joining in remotely).
>
> ABG runs on PHP 5 and Apache (which is provided with the Windows installer). It supports flipping, stacking, rotating, rolling, and shuffling of pieces, so most board and card games are playable.
