> ### Anywhere-Board-Games
> ##### Description
> 
> Anywhere Board Games (ABG) allows users to play board and card games on the web in real time on multiple machines (PC, Linux, iPhone, iPad, and Android). ABG runs as a Google+ Hangout App (go to http://anywhereboardgames.com to start it), or as a stand-alone PHP app.
>
> Unlike other gaming environments, we had a peculiar vision: projecting the main board on our table and using laptops or tablets to control our hands (with other friends joining in remotely).
>
> ABG runs on PHP 5 and Apache (which is provided with the Windows installer). It supports flipping, stacking, rotating, rolling, and shuffling of pieces, so most board and card games are playable.

#### Introduction to this repository 
Unfortunately I'm not a programmer, but I want other people on Github to find out about Anywhere Board Games in the hopes that you will enjoy it and contribute to the project. This is my Github placeholder for Anywhere Board Games (http://anywhereboardgames.com/). Credit for the program goes to [Robert Buccigrossi (doctor_butch) over on SourceForge.org](http://sourceforge.net/u/userid-66675/profile/). 

I found Anywhere Board Games (ABG) when I was looking for a way to play checkers through a browser without people having to sign up or download anything. 

#### Features
Anwhere Board Games has the ability to create and load game pieces of your choice. You can create your own game pieces by importing images and assigning behaviors to them. Using ABG you can convert nearly any board game you own and play online without any programming skill, just drop down menus.

#### Exisiting resources
Anywhere Board Games comes with: 
* six-sided dice, 
* standard playing cards (the ability to shuffle), 
* flipping coin(s). 

Also included are all the boards and pieces needed to play:
* Agricola Express, 
* checkers, 
* chess, 
* go, 
* reversi, and 
* "Words" (a generic version of Scrabble). 

#### Future of this repository
I don't want to detract from the developer of Anywhere Board Games, and I don't have the skills to fork and maintain a project like ABG. So my proposal for this space is to collect resources that could be used to extend the public domain and Open Source selection of board and table top games. 

Please DO NOT submit images or resources from material you do not own the copyright to unless it is under an Open Licence that allows its use here or if it is in the public domain. 
Some ideas for game resources that could be added here:
* Chinese checkers
* https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/171/public-domain
